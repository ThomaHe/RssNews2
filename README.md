# RssNews2

Improved version of my previous project RssReader

The app still reads the feed from "Le Monde" but is built differently, i hope it is better

##Technical choices
* Butterknife (still a good idea for a small project like this)
* Picasso (still a good idea too since i don't modify the pictures)
* Retrofit for getting the feed, seems like a better choice
* DbFlow (lighter than Realm)
